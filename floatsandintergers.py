# difference between float and int 
# Float = value + decimals ex 2.343, 4322.04 Int = whole number 5, 2, 343454535354, 
## integers into float 

# int(5) + 4.5 -> float

#find the radius of a circle

pi = 3.14 #float
r = 3

radiusOfACirlce = pi*r**2


print(radiusOfACirlce)

#what is a scenario in life that you would only use whole numbers?

#hmm your age?

# okay lets write a program that adds together to peoples ages

age1 = 26
age2 = 23

sumOfAge = age1 + age2

print("The sum of " + str(age1) + " and " + str(age2) + " is = " + str(sumOfAge))


#this is an example where you only want to be using integers. 
#if we run that it wont create a problem for us because we are adding 
#integers and string? 

#good catch, yes it will. but we can use fuction to convert integers to strings as well. one moment...

#no problem, would that function be str()?!!!! YES
