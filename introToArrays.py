# intro to arrays
# arrays must be of the same data type. 
# Ex: Array of Strings. studentsNames = ["John", "Sam", "Rob"]
# Ex: Array of ints. classesScores = [86, 74, 56]

classesScores = [86, 74, 56] # This is defined as an array of elements or a list of elements

# You can access elements in an array with there index.
# Array indexing start from the 0th index for the 1st element of the array.

print(claseScores[0]) 
# output = 86

print(claseScores[1]) 
# output = 74

print(claseScores[2]) 
# output = 56



studentsNames = ["John", "Sam", "Rob"]

print(studentsNames[0]) 
# output = John

print(studentsNames[1]) 
# output = Sam

print(studentsNames[2]) 
# output = Rob
